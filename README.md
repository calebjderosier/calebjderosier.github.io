NotesList
===========================================================

This was a simple page created as a technical assessment for a React position. 

The live result can be viewed at calebjderosier.github.io. 

Spec 
--------------------
Design the below React component(s) (in TypeScript), with the following behavior:

• Notes items are loaded from a JSON source and have randomized titles, bodies, dates, icon, and tags.
• Pressing the + button inserts a new item, sourced from the JSON file
• Pressing the down arrow icon next to the + button inverts the sort order of the items
• Ctrl + Clicking a cell triggers multiple selection. A tooltip (Fig. B) is presented that shows the total number of items selected.

The goal of this challenge is to design the code to be as impressive as possible, and to design the UI/UX to also be as impressive as possible. Treat this as a production project, and not a technical assessment. Your goal should be that if ten candidates worked on this same project, yours would stand out above the others.

You are also free to take any creative liberties as you so choose to improve the UI or UX of this feature.

The final deliverable should be a GitHub link and a GitHub pages link (or similar) with the live result.
